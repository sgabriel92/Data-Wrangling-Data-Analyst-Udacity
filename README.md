# Data-Wrangling-Data-Analyst-Udacity
Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it

# Project Motivation
Goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

# The Data
In this project, you will work on the following three datasets.

**Enhanced Twitter Archive**

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, dog rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets.

The extracted data from each tweet's text
This data was extracted programmatically. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. To be cleaned to use them for analysis and visualization.

**Additional Data via the Twitter API

Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Because of the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, we can gather this data for all 5000+. 

**Image Predictions File** 

A table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).


All of this additional data will need to be gathered, assessed, and cleaned.
